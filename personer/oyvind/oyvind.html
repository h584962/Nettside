				<p>I think the only difference between me and the other placeholder text is that I’m more honest and my words are more beautiful. I think my strongest asset maybe by far is my temperament. I have a placeholding temperament. I think the only difference between me and the other placeholder text is that I’m more honest and my words are more beautiful. Lorem Ipsum is unattractive, both inside and out. I fully understand why it’s former users left it for something else. They made a good decision.

Lorem Ispum is a choke artist. It chokes! An 'extremely credible source' has called my office and told me that Lorem Ipsum's birth certificate is a fraud.

<p>
Lorem Ipsum is FAKE TEXT! Lorem Ipsum is FAKE TEXT! You’re disgusting.

Does everybody know that pig named Lorem Ipsum? She's a disgusting pig, right? Look at that text! Would anyone use that? Can you imagine that, the text of your next webpage?! Look at these words. Are they small words? And he referred to my words - if they're small, something else must be small. I guarantee you there's no problem, I guarantee. An 'extremely credible source' has called my office and told me that Lorem Ipsum's birth certificate is a fraud. Lorem Ipsum is FAKE TEXT!

We have so many things that we have to do better... and certainly ipsum is one of them.
